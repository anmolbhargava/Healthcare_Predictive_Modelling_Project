# Health-Care-ML-Project

This project focuses on the healthcare industry, specifically predicting returning patients to a hospital (patients who are readmitted or return to a hospital within 30 days of being discharged). 
 
Ultimately, the job is to predict if a patient will return to a hospital within 30 days of being discharged (the variable Return).
